# ForReal

ForReal is a mobile application that allows users to share their thoughts on a daily prompt to the rest of the world. Itâ€™s Twitter meets Reddit meets YikYak with the daily habit stimulation of Wordle and BeReal. ForReal is different since users can only see other responses after posting their own.

Current social media has been criticized for the emergence of echo chambers and filtered realities. We hope our application can help push users to develop their own original opinions before interacting with other posts.

## Tech Stack

Our full-stack application is using React Native & Firebase.

1. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) - a client-side JavaScript framework
2. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) - serverless backend functionality

React Native allows us to deploy a dynamic client-side application for both Android and iOS. Firebase is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime. Firebase provides cross-platform SDKs to help you build and ship apps on Android, iOS and the web.
